change_ownership.sh
---

Script will change all objects ownership from x to y in a particular schema. 


* Step 1


        Before running script you need to set environment variables so that Pg-dump/psql client used in script will connect using these variables.
        ```
        export PGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres PGDATABASE=postgres PGPORT=5432
        ```

* Step 2

        You need to pass two mandatory arguments like NEW USER name ( -n ) and SCHEMA NAME ( -S ).

        sh change_owner.sh -n user1 -S xml
